Just so nobody is conufused this is about the blue people not the Last Airbender.

It is about a man who was paralized from the waist down in a war on Earth. He goes to another planet to be 
mind melded with a copy of the native people that live on the planet so he could help be a diplomat. 

throughout the movie the humans slowly start to look like the bad guys and he falls in love in love with the daughter 
chief, and eventually turns against the humans. 

The movie ends with him and the others pushing the humans out of the planet. 

Overall it was an okay movie and not really any problem with the movie other than it was a little cliche. 

Of course humans turn out to be the bad guys because why wouldn't they?
